**Summary:** 
<br>

Thanks to near-ubiquitous deployment of smart devices (e.g. security cameras, voice assistants, smart appliances), our homes, offices, and many public spaces are filled with IoT devices. While initially designed to improve efficiency and quality of our life,  these devices also pose a real security and privacy risk to all of us.   In this talk, we will discuss two types of security and privacy risks related to smart devices:  an explicit one (microphones that commonly exist in many devices) and an implicit one (WiFi devices that can silently monitor our movements behind the wall using WiFi  signals).   We will then discuss practical defense mechanisms against those two risks.

**Heather Zheng**  received her PhD degree from University of Maryland, College Park in 1999. After spending six years as researchers in industry labs (Bell-Labs, Crawford Hill, NJ, and Microsoft Research Asia), she joined the UC Santa Barbara faculty in 2005, and became Associate and Full professor in 2009 and 2013, respectively. In July 2017, Prof. Zheng joined University of Chicago as the Neubauer Professor in Computer Science. Some of her awards include the IEEE Fellow (2015), the MIT Technology Review’s TR-35 (Young Innovators Under 35) and the World Technology Network Fellow.   Professor Zheng has been actively working on security and privacy issues for both machine learning models and mobile computing systems. Her research work has been frequently featured by media outlets, such as New York Times, Boston Globe, LA Times, MIT Technology Review, and Computer World.   Her work on  cognitive radios was named the MIT Technology Review’s top-10 Emerging Technologies in 2006.  She was the TPC co-chair of MobiCom’15 and DySPAN’11 conferences. Currently she serves on the steering committee of MobiCom and as the chair of the SIGMOBILE Highlights committee.
