**Summary:** 
<br>

Cultural stereotypes such as the idea that men are more suited for paid work while women for taking care of the home and family may contribute to gender imbalances in STEM fields (e.g., Leslie, Cimpian, Meyer, & Freeland, 2015) and other undesirable gender disparities. Here, we test the hypothesis that word co-occurrence statistics (e.g., the co-occurrence of “nurse” with “she”) play a causal role in the formation of the men-career/women-family stereotype. We use word embedding models to measure bias in the distributional statistics of 25 languages and find that languages with larger biases tend to have speakers with larger implicit biases (N = 657,335). These biases are further related to the extent that languages mark gender in their lexical forms (e.g., “waiter”/“waitress”) hinting that linguistic biases may be causally related to biases shown in people's implicit judgments.

**Molly Lewis**  is a Research Scientist at Carnegie Mellon University in the Psychology and Social and Decision Sciences Departments. She received her PhD from Stanford University in Developmental Psychology, and her BA from Reed College in Linguistics. Molly is broadly interested in understanding how cognitive pressures in individual minds lead to law-like patterns in social systems, like language. She is also interested in meta-scientific questions in psychology about replicability and theory building. She uses a range of methods in her research, including experiments, meta-analysis, NLP techniques, and analysis of large-scale extant datasets.
