**Summary:** More than 90% of machine learning applications improve with human feedback. For example, autonomous vehicles understand how to distinguish a "Pedestrian" from a "Cyclist" because people have spent 1000s of hours manually annotating pedestrians and cyclists in videos. However, when there are millions of hours of video from an autonomous vehicle, it might not be feasible to manually annotate more than 1% of that footage. If we just sample randomly, we will mostly get highway driving where the autonomous vehicle is already very skilled. So, we need to be smarter about how we sample. This talk is about "Active Learning" the process of deciding what raw data is the most optimal for human review. The general techniques for Active Learning apply to many machine learning problems in addition to autonomous vehicles, from commands spoken to smart devices to extracting information extraction from healthcare-related messages.
